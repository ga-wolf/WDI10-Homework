// CAT WALK

// Create a new Javascript file and link to it with a script tag at the bottom.
// Create a variable to store a reference to the img.
// Change the style of the img to have a "left" of "0px", so that it starts at the left hand of the screens.
// Create a function called catWalk() that moves the cat 10 pixels to the right of where it started, by changing the "left" style property.
// Call that function every 50 milliseconds. Your cat should now be moving across the screen from left to right. Hurrah!

// Bonus #1: When the cat reaches the right-hand of the screen, restart them at the left hand side ("0px"). So they should keep walking from left to right across the screen, forever and ever.

// Bonus #2: When the cat reaches the right-hand of the screen, make them move backwards instead. They should keep walking back and forth forever and ever.

// Bonus #3: When the cat reaches the middle of the screen, replace the img with an image of a cat dancing, keep it dancing for 10 seconds, and then replace the img with the original image and have it continue the walk.
